![robinhood-logo](https://seekvectorlogo.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/robinhood-vector-logo.png)
## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Robinhood Financial, LLC

* **When was the company incorporated?**

2013

* Who are the founders of the company?

Baiju Bhatt & Vlad Tenev

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Baiju Bhatt & Vlad Tenev realized Wall Street firms weren't paying commission fees, while retail investors sometimes lost all their profits paying for commissions. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Robinhood has undergone 21 funding rounds, totaling 54 investors; Robinhood boasts $5.6B in total funding.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Robinhood set out to democratize investing by providing a commission-free brokerage available to all kinds of investors. Robinhood paved the road for millions to finally experience a world traditionally reserved for the wealthy.


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)  
Robinhood's intended customer is the average retail investor. Typically, to truly reap the stock market's benefits, an investor had to have over $25,000 or $250,000 to invest in a hedge fund in the US. Through Robinhood, middle-class citizens could take small amounts of capital and make millions. 
 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)  
Robinhood uses python to handle their backend while also using react for web browsers and swift for their IOS application. Furthermore, Robinhood's DevOps uses AWS to scale its application.  


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?  
I believe Robinhood falls under the domain of Robo advisors & personal finance. I say this because no account minimums and the complete control of investment decisions allow Robinhood's customers to take their financial goals into their own hands. Middle-class people could now make investment decisions at their discretion. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
A significant trend in the last 5-10 years in the Robo advisors & personal finance domain is algorithms, and digital UI has come to dominate this space. Furthermore, brokers do not charge broker fees anymore, which is a massive change in the industry; brokers no longer have traditional account minimums like before and now offer no minimums.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
There are a ton but to name a few: Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Webull, and Interactive Brokers.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Robinhood's commission-free model affected the industry tremendously. Every stock brokerage had to convert to this model because of Robinhood. Furthermore, we can thank Robinhood for no account minimums. Robinhood was a significant catalyst in growing the population of retail investors.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?The number of users and revenue are great metrics to indicate success. Robinhood has about 13 million customers, and TD Ameritrade (TDA) has about 11 million customers. However, when comparing Robinhood's number of users to Fidelity, which boasts 35 million users, Robinhood is a small brokerage.  Robinhood's revenue is about $600 million, small compared to TDA's $1.6 billion, and minuscule compared to Fidelity's whopping $20.9 billion.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Robinhood was doing well before restricting trades on GameStop (GME). Their decisions on the event showed they are far from being a big player in the industry and will probably never reach the point where they don't make money through payment for order flow—forcing Robinhood to stay a small brokerage forever.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
Robinhood implemented features such as margin, options, credit spreads, crypto,  and fractional shares, making them big competitors. My suggestion for features to add is a premium-subscription investment and retirement advice and adding advanced charting for all users. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Many people invest in the stock market to prepare for retirement; therefore, offering retirement advice and goals would draw in a whole new client base. Advanced charting would tap into the market of technical analysis fiends. People who rely on technical analysis to make trades refrain from using Robinhood because their "advanced" charts only offer 10-minute interval candlesticks. Robinhood needs to add smaller intervals and drawing capabilities to keep up with the applications that appeal to those who need it. Robinhood can make a profit from these features by adding a monthly fee for them. Robinhood should also add educational resources from basics such as buying and selling to advanced strategies such as credit spreads and iron condors to attract more clients.
Additionally, a paper trades feature would benefit them greatly. All educational resources should be offered free of charge. Having customers who will learn on your platform guarantees a lower churn rate at the end of each year.


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Robinhood would have to seriously revamp AWS for all the hosting capabilities for the educational resources. Robinhood would have to add some functions to their React for browsers and Swift for their IOS  Application for the drawing capabilities and changing the time intervals since they already have the AWS capabilities for real-time data.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
AWS definitely is the backend for Robinhood processing millions of transactions. React and Swift change the front end of application.
