## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Robinhood Financial, LLC

* **When was the company incorporated?**

2013

* Who are the founders of the company?

Baiju Bhatt & Vlad Tenev

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Baiju Bhatt & Vlad Tenev realized Wall Street firms weren't paying commission fees, while retail investors sometimes lost all their profits paying for commissions. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Robinhood has undergone 21 funding rounds, totaling 54 investors; Robinhood boasts $5.6B in total funding.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Robinhood set out to democratize investing by providing a commission-free brokerage available to all kinds of investors. Robinhood paved the road for millions to finally experience a world traditionally reserved for the wealthy.


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)  
Robinhood's intended customer is the average retail investor. Typically, to truly reap the stock market's benefits, an investor had to have over $25,000 or $250,000 to invest in a hedge fund in the US. Through Robinhood, middle-class citizens could take small amounts of capital and make millions. 
 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)  
Robinhood uses python to handle their backend while also using react for web browsers and swift for their IOS application. Furthermore, Robinhood's DevOps uses AWS to scale its application.  


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?  
I believe Robinhood falls under the domain of Robo advisors & personal finance. I say this because no account minimums and the complete control of investment decisions allow Robinhood's customers to take their financial goals into their own hands. Middle-class people could now make investment decisions at their discretion. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
A significant trend in the last 5-10 years in the Robo advisors & personal finance domain is algorithms, and digital UI has come to dominate this space. Furthermore, brokers do not charge broker fees anymore, which is a massive change in the industry; brokers no longer have traditional account minimums like before and now offer no minimums.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
There are a ton but to name a few: Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Webull, and Interactive Brokers.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Robinhood's commission-free model affected the industry tremendously. Every stock brokerage had to convert to this model because of Robinhood. Furthermore, we can thank Robinhood for no account minimums. Robinhood was a significant catalyst in growing the population of retail investors.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
Robinhood implemented features such as margin, options, credit spreads, crypto,  and fractional shares making them big competitors. My suggestion is Robinhood needs to start inflitrating the market of professional investors. One form of doing so is offering more such as forex, mutual funds, and shorting. Another feature Robinhood can add is advanced charting.
